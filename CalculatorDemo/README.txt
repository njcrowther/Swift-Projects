Project 1 - Calculator

For the most, I found the project very interesting. I learned a lot about how Swift works; what it does the same and differently than other languages.

Steps 1-6 were relatively easy and once I got Swift syntax down they didn't take me very long to hook up. I felt like these steps were implemented with best coding practices (to the best of my knowledge) and are very efficient.

Steps 7-8 were where I really got stuck. They took me a couple days to figure out the recursive function as well as how to display the description to the screen. For some reason it just took me awhile to wrap my head around how the recursion would actually work for creating a string in backwords chronological order. I felt like I really put the time and energy into understanding these steps.

Overall, my code is clean. I think I used pretty descriptive variables and made it readable so that someone could follow my thought process pretty well.
