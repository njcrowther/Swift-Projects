User Experience: My first inclination with this project was to show the user's location whenever a place wasn't selected. This would mostly happen when first launching the app. However, my wife told me this wouldn't be as good of an experience. I still learned how to do it and commented out the code. 

My code isn't perfect. I didn't figure out how to query the database for the volumes. Other things aren't as perfect as I'd like, but it's all functional. Also, for some reason it only works in landscape. Not sure why.
