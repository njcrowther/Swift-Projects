User Test
I had my wife play my game. She had some pretty good feedback. She noted that it should be a little more obvious whether the player got the match correct or not. There were also a few bugs in the animations like selected and deselecting an image. 

She also suggested the fire in the background if you get it wrong. Normally I wouldn't, but just to see if I could figure out how to do it I went ahead and did it. Patterning an image was about the best I could do, but I think it turned out pretty good. 


Extra Temples
I added a number of other temples. These include:
Sacramento and Oakland CA - temples in my mission
Medford OR - another temple in my mission
Jordan River - Temple that I grew up going to
Salt Lake - Temple where I received my endowments
Columbia River WA - I would have added this to my list as it's where I got married, but it was already included.
